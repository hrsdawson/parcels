    "One of the features of Parcels is that it can directly and natively work with `Field` data discretised on C-grids. These C grids are very popular in OGCMs, so velocity fields outputted by OGCMs are often provided on such grids, except if they have been firstly re-interpolated on a A grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "More information about C-grid interpolation can be found in [Delandmeter et al., 2019](https://www.geosci-model-dev-discuss.net/gmd-2018-339/).\n",
    "An example of such a discretisation is the NEMO model, which is one of the models supported in Parcels. A tutorial teaching how to [interpolate 2D data on a NEMO grid](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/OceanParcels/parcels/blob/master/parcels/examples/tutorial_nemo_curvilinear.ipynb) is available within Parcels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we focus on 3D fields. Basically, it is a straightforward extension of the 2D example, but it is very easy to do a mistake in the setup of the vertical discretisation that would affect the interpolation scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preliminary comments\n",
    "\n",
    "*How to know if your data is discretised on a C grid?* The best way is to read the documentation that comes with the data. Alternatively, an easy check is to assess the coordinates of the U, V and W fields: for an A grid, U, V and W are distributed on the same nodes, such that the coordinates are the same. For a C grid, there is a shift of half a cell between the different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What about grid indexing?* Since the C-grid variables are not located on the same nodes, there is not one obvious way to define the indexing, i.e. where is `u[k,j,i]` compared to `v[k,j,i]` and `w[k,j,i]`. In Parcels, we use the same notation as in NEMO: see [horizontal indexing](https://www.nemo-ocean.eu/doc/img360.png) and [vertical indexing](https://www.nemo-ocean.eu/doc/img362.png).\n",
    "It is important that you check if your data is following the same notation. Otherwise, you should re-index your data properly (this can be done within Parcels, there is no need to regenerate new netcdf files).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to create a 3D NEMO `dimensions` dictionary?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we will show how to create the `dimensions` dictionary for 3D NEMO simulations. What you require is a 'mesh_mask' file, which in our case is called `coordinates.nc` but in some other versions of NEMO has a different name. In any case, it will have to contain the variables `glamf`, `gphif` and `depthw`, which are the longitude, latitude and depth of the mesh nodes, respectively. Note that `depthw` is not part of the mesh_mask file, but is in the same file as the w data (`wfiles[0]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the C-grid interpolation in Parcels to work properly, it is important that `U`, `V` and `W` are on the same grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below is an example of how to create a 3D simulation with particles, starting in the mouth of the river Rhine at 1m depth, and advecting them through the North Sea using the `AdvectionRK4_3D`"
