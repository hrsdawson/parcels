Parcels development status
===================================

The current release of Parcels, version 0.9, is a fully-functional, feature-complete code for offline Lagrangian ocean analysis. See below for a list of features, or keep an eye 
on the `Github Development Timeline page
<https://github.com/OceanParcels/parcels/projects/1>`_

**Currently implemented in v0.9**

* Advection of particles in 2D using inbuilt kernels for Runge-Kutta4, Runge-Kutta45 and Euler Forward and in 3D using the inbuilt kernel for Runge-Kutta4_3D (see :mod:`parcels.kernels.advection`)
* Ability to define and execute custom kernels (see `this part of the Tutorial <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/OceanParcels/parcels/blob/master/examples/parcels_tutorial.ipynb#Adding-a-custom-behaviour-kernel>`_)
* Ability to add custom Variables to Particles (see `this part of the Tutorial <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/OceanParcels/parcels/blob/master/examples/parcels_tutorial.ipynb#Sampling-a-Field-with-Particles>`_)
* Ability to add and remove Particles (see :func:`parcels.particleset.ParticleSet.add` and :func:`parcels.particleset.ParticleSet.remove`)
* Ability to run in both Scipy and JIT (Just-In-Time compilation) mode. The former is easier to debug, but the latter can be a factor 1,000 faster (see the `JIT-vs-Scipy tutorial <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/OceanParcels/parcels/blob/master/examples/tutorial_jit_vs_scipy.ipynb>`_)
* Ability to read in any type of hydrodynamic field in NetCDF format, as long as the grid is rectangular (i.e. grid axes are aligned with longitude and latitude; see :mod:`parcels.fieldset.FieldSet.from_netcdf` and `this part of the Tutorial <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/OceanParcels/parcels/blob/master/examples/parcels_tutorial.ipynb#Reading-in-data-from-arbritrary-NetCDF-files>`_)
* Output particles in NetCDF format (see :mod:`parcels.particlefile`)
* Basic plotting of particles, both on the fly and from netcdf output files (see the `plotting tutorial <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/OceanParcels/parcels/blob/master/examples/tutorial_plotting.ipynb>`_)

**Major developed goals beyond v0.9**

* Diffusion of particles using suite of inbuilt kernels
* Support for non-rectangular grids, including unstructured meshes
* Implementation of parallel execution using tiling of the domain
* Faster and more efficient code
* Advanced control of particles near land boundaries


Parcels Tutorials 
===================================

The best way to get started with Parcels is to have a look at the Jupyter notebooks below:

* `Parcels tutorial <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/OceanParcels/parcels/blob/master/examples/parcels_tutorial.ipynb>`_ for a general introduction and overview into the main features of Parcels

* `FieldSet.advancetime() tutorial <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/OceanParcels/parcels/blob/master/examples/tutorial_advancetime.ipynb>`_ for a tutorial on how to use Parcels with datasets that have a large number of time snapshots.

* `Delayed start of particles tutorial <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/OceanParcels/parcels/blob/master/examples/tutorial_delaystart.ipynb>`_ for a tutorial on how to add particles to a ParticleSet during runtime, so that not all particles are released on the start of the run.

* `JIT-vs-Scipy tutorial <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/OceanParcels/parcels/blob/master/examples/tutorial_jit_vs_scipy.ipynb>`_ for a tutorial showing how JIT  and Scipy mode compare.

* `Animated Gif tutorial <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/OceanParcels/parcels/blob/master/examples/tutorial_Agulhasparticles.ipynb>`_ for a  tutorial on how to created the Agulhas region animated gif on the top of this page. This tutorial also features a brief explanation of how to handle `OutOfBounds` errors.

Installing Parcels
===================================

The latest version of Parcels, including tests and examples, 
can be obtained directly from github via::
    git clone https://github.com/OceanParcels/parcels.git
    cd parcels; pip install -r requirements.txt
    python scripts/pull_data.py
    export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$PWD"

In order for Parcels to work from any directory, add the following line to 
your ~/.bash_profile::
    export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$PWD"

Note that a functional NetCDF install is required.

Windows specific installation instructions
------------------------------------------

To enable Parcels to run on a Windows machine, some extra steps have to be taken to install the necessary prerequisite files. Windows must have the following software before it is able to run Parcels:
* A working distribution of gcc must be installed. With working is meant that gcc an be accessed from the commandline. We suggest Windows users to install the [MinGW Package](www.mingw.org). Do note that to access the gcc compiler which MinGW provides, the user must most likely add the directory path to the `MinGW\bin` folder where gcc resides.
* A version of python with a working copy of Numpy and SciPy. We recommend you to install a scientific Python distribution, like [anaconda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python), which provides the easier way to install Numpy and SciPy. However, it is also possible to use a version of Python distributed by the Python organisation (make sure you grab the version 2 branch of Python). After installing Python you can install the packages manually by downloading the appropriate versions of these packages from this repository of [pre-built Windows installers](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/). Use the command `python -m pip install 'package'` to install these modules.

To grab the latest version of Parcels with tests and examples, you can follow these steps::
    git clone https://github.com/OceanParcels/parcels.git
    cd parcels && pip install -r requirements.txt
    python scripts/pull_data.py
    set "PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;%cd%"

Python, however, cannot yet access Parcels in each session. To add the directory where Parcels resides as a permanent module directory to Python, add or set the `PYTHONPATH` variable in your system's environmental variables.

Writing Parcels Kernels
===================================

One of the most powerful features of Parcels is the ability to write custom Kernels (see e.g. `this part of the Tutorial <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/OceanParcels/parcels/blob/master/examples/parcels_tutorial.ipynb#Adding-a-custom-behaviour-kernel>`_). These Kernels are little snippets of code that get executed by Parcels, giving the ability to add 'behaviour' to particles. 

However, there are some key limitations to the Kernels that everyone who wants to write their own should be aware of:

* Every Kernel must be a function with the following (and only those) arguments: ``(particle, fieldset, time, dt)``

* In order to run successfully in JIT mode, Kernel definitions can only contain the following types of commands:

  * Basic arithmetical operators (``+``, ``-``, ``*``, ``/``) and assignments (``=``).

  * Basic logical operators (``<``, ``==``, ``>``, ``&``, ``|``)

  * ``if`` and ``while`` loops, as well as ``break`` statements. Note that ``for``-loops are not supported in JIT mode
    
  * Interpolation of a ``Field`` from the ``fieldset`` at a (time, lon, lat, depth) point, using using square brackets notation. For example, to interpolate the zonal velocity (`U`) field at the particle location, use the following statement::

      value = fieldset.U[time, particle.lon, particle.lat, particle.depth]

  * Functions from the ``maths`` standard library and from the custom ``random`` library at :mod:`parcels.rng`
  
  * ``print`` statements. Note however that in JIT mode these only work well for variables that are either floats or any of the inbuilt Particle properties

* Local variables can be used in Kernels, and these variables will be accessible in all concatenated Kernels. Note that these local variables are not shared between particles, and also not between time steps.

All other functions and methods are not supported yet in Parcels Kernels. If there is a functionality that can not be programmed with this limited set of commands, please create an `Issue ticket <https://github.com/OceanParcels/parcels/issues>`_.
